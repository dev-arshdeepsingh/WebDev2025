Selector is the ability to select any element on webpage.
Tailwind is inspired by facebook tools.
DOM refers to Document Object model which tells us how our page is structured
In parent- child relationship in html, after 1st level we call it as descendants, instead of child -> Subchild -> Sub Sub Child etc.

All the browsers add some pre existing CSS no matter whether it is edge, chrome or Arc.
Universal Selector has to be on top of CSS as we want to execute on whole webpage.
*{
    margin : 0;
    padding : 0;
    box-sizing : border-box;
}


02. Type Selector:
Just name the tag and css will be applied to all tags of that name

Q: Diff. b/w margin & paddding is imp.


Now, margin : 1 3 4 5;  // top right bottom left
padding: 1 2 3 // Top BothLeftAndRight bottom
margin: 1 2// Top&bottom Left&Right
We also have Margin Top bottom left and right so that we can add margin from each sides separately

An html element on webpage = space of element + padding + border + margin // This is border boxing

Margin is distance between element and its neighbouring element
padding is inside space or inner space
We can control margin and padding from all directions ie top-> right-> bottom-> left


03. Class Selector

We can assign classes to multiple html elements and then we can select those group of elements as a class in css
We will use "." to select class
Tailwind is a library that generate classes for us

04. ID Selector
We can IDs to each element in html
We can assign only 1 unique ID to every element
"#" is used to select an element via ID
We can use various ways to use colours in webpage eg: Hash Code(common), HSL, HWB, RGB etc
We use these as red color for 1 browser maybe different for other, But hashcode is same.


05. Attribute Selector:
In this we chose Attribute of an html element
eg: input[type='text']{             //Used to select text in input
    border: 10px solid #21a2c9;
}

//These are extended selector which are used by those who love too much CSS.
01. descendants selector:
eg:
article p{
    //code 
}
In above we have selected all p tags which are descendants of aricle to apply css.
PRO TIP: Always read parent-child CSS from right to left, eg: p tags which are descendants of article.

descendants means all child, Subchild, subsubchild etc.


02. child selector: Used in list
eg:
ul > li{

}

Note: Here if we do 
article > p{ 

}
Then only those p tags which are directly child of article will be selected unlike descendants selector where grand & grand grand child are also selected.

03. adjacent sibling selector: Not imp.

04. general sibling selector (Not imp.)

05.pseudo class selector:(Imp.): They are used to show behaviour of element.
eg:
a:hover {
        background-color: #14a50e;
        text-decoration: none;
        color: #1a1a1a;
        padding: 5px;
        margin: 4px;
      }

06. pseudo element selector: Quite advanced, as it is also used in magzines.
For eg: Increasing size of 1st letter of p all tags in webpage.

p::first-letter {
        font-weight: bold;
        font-size: 30px;
      }


07.grouping selector: Used to select multiple elements,

eg: h1, p, h2{
    color: orange;
}
