// SQL is a domain specific lang. it only have simple english like queries. 
// SQl is used to create & modify DB's schema which is nothing but the structure of the DB.
// Structured data is any data that looks like a table or a spreadsheet like excel. 
// ie we know precisely where name will go where last name will go where email will go.
// structure remains same throughout the data for every user.
// If we want to add a new column, we need to modify the whole schema for every user.
// SQL follows this hard structured data.
// SQL is also called as Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) which is data in the form of rows & columns.

//Relation b/w 2 or more tables is formed with a key called as Foreign Key.
// Each table has a primary key which is unique for each row. 
// Hence foreig key of one table can be primary key of another table.

// NoSQL is a non-relational database management system (NRDBMS) that stores data in a non-tabular format.
// This can be as flexible as we want & as rigid as SQL. So yeah NOSQL can behave as SQL if we add to much of the restrictions.
// But their structure still will be diff. as SQL will be tabular form while NOSQL will be in document form.

//In NOSQL, we can store one person's data with Only "Name", while the other person's data can have "Name", "Email", "Phone" etc. & both can be stored together in same DB. But it's not possible in SQL as there is a schema.
// SQL is very rigid in terms of structure.
// in NOSQL, we can defne new structure for some of the data like Mp3 files etc.
// Types of NOSQL: document, key-value, graph, columnar etc.
// NoSQL are known for scaling horizontally.
