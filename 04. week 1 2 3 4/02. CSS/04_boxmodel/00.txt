Now, note that :
When we apply box-sizing:content-box via universal Selector then when we apply margin, padding & border to any html element then the padding & border space is calculated explicitely.
Container Size = ContainerSize + padding + border
Eg: When you assign 300px to the container, then u will end up with more as it will consume more space using border & Padding.


While in box-sizing: border-box, the size occupied by that div is fixed and the content's size changes accordingly w.r.t padding and border.So it doesn;t impacts the size of container.
Container Size = Fixed ie which is added manually
Content Size changes.
Here when u assign 300px to an element or div then it will guaranteedly consume only 300px inclusive of border & Padding.

Inline Vs  Block:
Inline Element only occupies the reqd. space.
Block Element occupies whole width of the screen.

We can change default behaviour of element using display CSS's property.
Flex is Imp. in it.
