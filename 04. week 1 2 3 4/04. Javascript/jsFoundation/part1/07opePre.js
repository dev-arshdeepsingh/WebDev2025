//Precedence and Associativity

//It is just for for the sake of understanding the order of operations. Not used in actual code. 
//Just used sometimes in DSA


//let score = 2 * 3 + 2 - 1; // Check precedence 
let score = ((2 * (3 + 2)) - 1); //Why even use above when we can literally write the code in a way that is easier to understand by applying the parenthesis & assign precedency ourself.
console.log(score);

//No need to remember the precedence, just use the parenthesis to make the code more readable.
