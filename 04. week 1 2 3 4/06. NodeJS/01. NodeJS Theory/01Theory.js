//Backend involves the processing of data or anything done in the serverside

//The backend is divided into 2 parts:
//1st part is the server where we deal with the databases (mongodb, mysql, etc)
//mysql & postgresis a sql database while mongodb & dynamoDB is a no sql database
//Now, how server & database interacts with each other is the backend

// On the other side we have browser which is a frontend, whhich we can design using core js ie without any framework. Or to make our life easier & make things faster we can use react/vue/angular 

//We study backend in 2 parts: Backend as a server & Backend as a database
//Now, server is also a S/W which is running on a machine, so we can also call it as a software. Many people think server as a hardware but no that are data centers where data is stored. Server are a software.

//Now, a computer has 35000 virtual ports using which it sends & receives data or atleast recieves a request for these operations.

//From, virtual port of frontend we send a request to get data to virtual port of backend.
//then backend sends a response to the frontend using same or diff. virtual port.
//& all of this is managed by an API (Application Programming Interface or Application Programmable Interface)
//Now, in backend we learn hw to make api's, how we can recieve requests & send data. Store data in DB, process data & add filters on it.

//We can write our servers in JS, but JS miss some new features, like it can't interat with files, network protocols, etc. Obviously beacuse it was written for browser.  But node.js(an advanced version of JS) can do all of this. 
// nodejs also imports from libuv which is a library for cross platform asynchronous I/O. It is not even written in JS yet nodejs is capable for importing from it. so we can estimete how powerful nodejs is.
// Libuv is written in C. Another library that nodejs can use is crypto. so see nodejs can use many libraries some which is developed by nodejs & rest are from 3rd party. They may be diff. langs but still we only need to manage nodejs so we would only be dealing wih JS only.
//The functionalities we need from these libraries will be directly imported by nodejs. 

//So we can use tons of libraries & frameworks in nodejs to make our life easier.
//another thing tat comes in nodejs is npm & people think its full form is node package manager but its not. It doesn't have a full form.
//Eg; date func. in JS is very complex but in nodejs we can use date-fns library to make it easier. It's quite popular.

//Another popular library is express.js. It's a framework for making api's. It's very popular & used by many companies. It is also based on node.js. & is available on npm website. It is ued in full stack projects.
//It has 30 million weekly downloads .

//As a user we only have to use JS, using which we can interact with npm & nodejs to access tons of libraries & frameworks & functionalities.
// npm is not directly part of nodejs, it is a separate entity, which interacts with nodejs pretty well.

//use either nodejs documentation or npm website to get functionalities.

//We don't need to learn whole nodejs because nobody does so we will learn only what we need. Eg: OS module which is used to interact with the operating system 7 has funtions like hostName, machine etc.

// It's not nodeJS, its libraries which it can use to help us write or code easily.
