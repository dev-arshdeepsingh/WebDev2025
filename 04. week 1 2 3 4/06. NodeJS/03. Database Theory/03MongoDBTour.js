//DB manages 2 things first the user & the network.
//Db will be hostedin separate computer. While the servers are on separate computers.
// We have to make sure that ip of server computer can access the db computer not anybody else. 
//While learnng we give 0.0.0.0/0 to have network access which means any ip can access the db computer. Because as soon as our computer starts our IP changes & we don't want to add the new ip agian & again.
// But in production we don't want to do this. We only give 1 ip because our server is on cloud & it never restarts.
