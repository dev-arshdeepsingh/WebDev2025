01. & 02................

One piece of advice, don't try to learn everything. & try to learn on the go.

MDN and w3 schools are good to use as documentations.

VS code provides emmet support with which we can write our code more fastly.eg: div>ul>li + enter

In img tag we use   ./  to enter a folder 
eg: ./images/hc.png

Anchor tag or a tag is used to add link on webpage
Inside a html tag there exists attributes. eg src in img and href in anchor.
lly, there is a title attribute which is used to add title on a html tag and it appears when we hover on that tag's content on webpage. Eg of attributes are height and width in image tag.
other eg. can be a:mail + enter will create an anchor tag with "MailTo" Reference.
eg. a:tel + Enter will open a tag with phone no. Reference

Infact, we can use "a" Tag to link other webpage or other html file in our vs code.
eg:  <a href="./index.html">go to index</a>

Lists are of 2 type ol ie ordered list and ul ie unordered list and li tag is used as sub tag to create list inside that tag.


2 types of html elements inline and block
block elements cover up the entire width of the screen whereas the inline take only the space rqd. by them. 
eg. of block elements are heading tag, li, ul, ol, p etc
eg. of inline elements are img, a tag, button, strong or Bold(<b>), emphasis or Italics(<i>)  etc


div is a wrapping container which doesn't do anything else except dividing the code into sub parts so that we can easily edit our code individually when our we want to.


03 & 04.............................................................

Tables were used to save scientific researches in early days by scientists
use MDN for everything, for eg. search for progrss bar, search etc in forms in html.

Be creative and try to figure out things on your own.

Forms are used to get data from user.
The action attribute in form will be discussed later.
Actually, forms don't collect data but the input element in form is responsible for collecting data.
As soon as we declare input element we get suggestions about various inputs types like email, phn, password, date , time etc.

We also use label in forms and note that if we declare input inside label then if we write text before input then it will appear before input element eg. 
<label for="email">
            email:
            <input placeholder="test" type="text" name="email">
        </label>



and if we write text after input then it will appear after input element eg checkbox
<label for="abc">           
            <input placeholder="test" type="checkbox" name="abc">
            Amritsar
        </label>

Button is mostly created at the end of form but note that it must be inside the form ag not outside form tag.
Button is also of various types but it depends on situation you can check on suggestion of vs code. like reset, submit etc


Textarea is also an element in form which is used to text area which can be used as feedback box. It also has rows and column size attribute.

Input element has month,file,color,checkbox, radio and select type also.

NOTE: ctrl + SPACE = suggestion of that element in vscode

Placeholder is an input & label attribute and is used to display a transparent text inside input box.

HTML is majorly used to either collect data from user and Display data to user.



05...............................................................

Semantics only guide webpage about how the content should be wrapped around, earlier we ussed to do use divs.

These are not elements but they are containers and they don't do anything of their own except wrapping. They enhances code readability.

html introduced semantics with html5.

header, nav, main, section, article, footer, time, code, address, figure etc.

& + "suggestion" = special logos (features of UTF8)
eg. &copy = copyright


media.html...........................

video tag is used
dont forget to add attribute like controls, controlslist = "nofullscreen nodownload noremoteplayback" etc

we can also add audio.

ARIA Tags: Accessible Rich Interface Application (Just to Explore)
Global attributes?

Right now imp. in html are heading, list, Tables, & Forms.

What does the action attribute in an HTML form do?
Which ARIA attribute is used to define a landmark region in a web page?
